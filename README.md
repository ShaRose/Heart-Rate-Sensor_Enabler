## Heart Rate Sensor Enabler for SGS5

by <i>sunilpaulmathew@xda-developers.com<i>

<b>Enable Heart Rate Sensor on Samsung Galaxy S5 Snapdragon 801 variants running AOSP based ROMs (Nougat/Oreo/Pie)</b>

### Description

Premium Samsung features, such as heart rate sensor, will not work on third-party operating systems (e.g. Lineage OS). This module however systemless-ly introduces necessary permissions and library files to enable Heart Rate Sensor on Samsung Galaxy S5 Snapdragon 801 variants (and possibly other Galaxy snapdragon devices) running AOPS based ROMs (Nought/Oreo/Pie).

### Requirements

* Previous health service installations, if any, should be removed
* Samsung Health configurations, if already made, should be erased
